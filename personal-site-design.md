1. What is your site's primary purpose?
    To provide a space for my reflections throught Dev Academy, as well as a place to refine the skills I am learning. Others from Dev Academy can also refer to the reflections.

2. Who is your target audience? 
    My teachers and fellow classmates - others learning to code and on this crazy journey with me. 

3. How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have? 
    I really want the site to look fun and relaxed, and for visitors to smile when they see little quirks, that kind of things. I want visitors to feel encouraged when they read the content. 

4. How will you build your site to support your desired user experience? 
    I know that I want the site to be responsive and I know that I want some quirky / interactive parts to it but I honestly have no idea how to implement that or how to make sure users have the desired experience. I'm going to go and learn about that during the sprint and hopefully be able to answer this kind of question afterwards.
